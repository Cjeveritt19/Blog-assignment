## Requesting feedback about a specific part of your submission.

## What useful external sources helped you complete the assignment (e.g Youtube tutorials)?

## What errors or bugs did you encounter while completing your assignment? How did you solve them?

I achieved all but two requirements which were the delete button and adding the comments to each post. I struggled with figuring out how to add both these components to my page adn the correct code for both of these.

I think if i couldve implemented the delete button and connecting the comments the project would have been so much better. But i think even without them i have made a good project and implemented what i have learnt recently and it feels good to use everything i have been taught.

I did encounter a few bugs with vercel but i had soon realised it was because i didnt add my env file to vercel.
